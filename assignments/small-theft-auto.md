# Assignment: Small Theft Auto

Please use the Unity Project under `projects/SmallTheftAuto` for this Assignment.\
This is a Group Assignment for 4 people per Group.\
I recommend the following work schedule:
- Between 9:00 and 16:00 (or 18:00)
- 2 Groups of Pair Programming Students 
  - one Student streams his Screen, the other follows and comments
  - switch the role of the active (typing) Programmer for each feature, but at least every 1.5 hours!
  - There have to be regular commits from EVERY TEAM MEMBER
  - Team Members without regular contributions will not receive a passing Grade
- Swap the Pairs every other day, make sure to work with every single team member of your team!
- I know, that it's much more comfortable, to:
  - Work alone, at your own pace, but you need to learn to communicate, discuss, etc. It's the best way of improving code quality and team quality!
  - Stick with the same team members every day, but you should get to know each other and learn, whom it is easier to work with, learn to work with people that might not be so easy to work with and give each other feedback and the chance to improve!
  - Commit only as soon as a whole feature is done, or the game is half-way done, but that's unprofessional and impossible to collaborate with, due to Merge Conflicts, so commit regularly and in small batches. It's better to lose 1 hour worth of work, if you have a huge, unresolvable conflict, than losing 5 days worth of work!
Here's the set of features that I'll be looking for:
